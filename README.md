# TetrisGame
A Tetris-like game that I built in React using Hooks. (Tutorial based)

Hi! This game was made following along with a Youtube tutorial that can be found below:

Why did I build this? 
To better undertand React Hooks and have a little fun while doing it.

I will be adding features to this app. I hope to completely stylize it so that it is uniquely mine with both additional features and my person themes.

I had a lot of fun building this out and was able to optimize a few things along the way.

If you are reading this, Enjoy and happy gaming!
